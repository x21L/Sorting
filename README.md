# Sorting

Your task is to implement at least two sorting algorithms:

* Bubble Sort
* Quick Sort

If you have already implemented one of these, choose another arbitrary one.

Test your implementations with different sizes of arrays.
It is sufficient if you use int arrays.

**Use methods for the different algorithms**. You also write a method for generating the arrays.
